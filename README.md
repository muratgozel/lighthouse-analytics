## Install
```sh
npm install lighthouse-analytics
```

## Import
There are different types of distributions depending on your use case. Essentially, the package can be imported via require:
```js
const {LighthouseAnalytics} = require('lighthouse-analytics')
```
or via script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/event-emitter-object@4/dist/event-emitter-object.iife.js" crossorigin type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/visibility-state-listener@2/dist/visibility-state-listener.iife.js" crossorigin type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/basekits@1/dist/basekits.iife.js" crossorigin type="text/javascript"></script>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/basekits@1/dist/lighthouse-analytics.iife.js" crossorigin type="text/javascript"></script>
```
but there are lots of other options. See distribution report below.

## Use
Initiate the client:
```js
const {LighthouseAnalytics, GoogleAnalytics} = require('lighthouse-analytics')
// init with default options
const analytics = new LighthouseAnalytics({
  trackVisibility: true,
  collectReferrer: true
})
```

### Context
Set user and app context as some analytics services require:
```js
analytics.setUser({
  id: ''
})
analytics.setApp({
  name: null,
  version: null,
  id: null
})
```

### Services
Add third party analytics services you would like to use:
```js
const ga = GoogleAnalytics({
  property: 'UA-123456789-X'
})
analytics.newService(ga).then(function() {
  // service is ready!
})
```

### Send Events
After services are ready you can start sending activities:
```js
analytics.newActivity('SCREEN', {title: 'Homepage'})
```

Pre-defined activities works seamlessly with third party services. Just send the right parameters:
```js
analytics.newActivity('SCREEN', {title: 'Homepage', url: location.href, path: '/'})
analytics.newActivity('EXCEPTION', {error: new Error('Ov no!')})
analytics.newActivity('SHARE', {channel: 'Twitter'})
analytics.newActivity('SEARCH', {query: 'something'})
analytics.newActivity('SIGNIN', {method: 'Apple'})
analytics.newActivity('SIGNUP', {method: 'Google'})
analytics.newActivity('TIMING', {name: 'Initial Render', value: 1200}) // in miliseconds
```

Custom events are also supported and relies on the value parameter:
```js
analytics.newActivity('SOMETHING', {value: 'some value.'})
```

#### Example use case: Measuring Reading
When user completes reading some content. It is possible with [readometer](https://github.com/muratgozel/readometer).
```js
const meter = new Readometer()

meter.on('progress', function(progress) {
  console.log('User read ' + progress + ' percent of the text.')

  if (progress >= 75) {
    analytics.newActivity('read', {
      value: 'My Article', // required
    })
  }
})

meter.start( document.getElementById('sample1'), 'en' )
```

### Internal Events
Lighthouse has its own [event-emitter](https://github.com/muratgozel/event-emitter-object) integrated and emits the following internal events for the developer:
```js
// if trackVisibility option set to true
analytics.on('visibility', function(value) {
  // value is either "visible" or "hidden"
})

// whenever a new activity registered
analytics.on('activity', function(activity, session) {

})
```

### What Actually Happens When User Visits Your Site/App
First of all, Lighthouse uses only local storage of the visitor's browser/device. There is no cookie created or used by Lighthouse.

Identification across visits happen by checking the identifier inside the local storage.

Client may read the following data of the visitor:
1. `document.referrer`
2. Tab/window visibility state (Through [visibility-state-listener](https://github.com/muratgozel/visibility-state-listener))
